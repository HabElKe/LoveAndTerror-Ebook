### CHAPTER 8

` `The next day, when Suraya finished teaching the children, Fariba told her that she had dresses that she wanted to give her, and they went to the basement together. On the way, Suraya noticed that the door to Baktash’s room was open. She peaked in to check whether he was inside. She saw him painting eyes which seemed very familiar, and realized they were her own. When Baktash realized that she was looking in his direction, he hid his work in panic. She entered the room and grabbed the painting. 

“I can explain,” Baktash said. 

 ` `She headed upstairs with the painting in her hands, not speaking a word. Baktash followed her. She ran into Kareem on her way up. The three of them fell silent, unsure of what to say. Suraya made her way back down to the basement, realizing she couldn’t leave to go to the guesthouse.   
As Baktash was heading back to his room, Kareem asked him: “What is she doing here?” 

“It’s none of your business,” Baktash said. 

“She is my fiancée and I have the right to ask and to know.” 

Baktash was bewildered: “What did you say?” 

Kareem replied: “Yesterday, your mother and Balqees went to ask for her hand in marriage on my behalf.” 

Baktash laughed and said: “Where do you even know her from? And how is she your fiancée after just a proposal?” 

“Never mind about that. What were you doing with her and why were you running after her?” Kareem’s voice was demanding. 

Baktash moved closer to him. He was tall, broad shouldered and stood upright while Kareem was short, his posture brought down by his weight, and visibly older. Baktash laughed. “Have you looked at yourself in a mirror? She could be your daughter. Why would she ever marry you?” Baktash left without waiting for Kareem’s reply.

Kareem went to Balqees. “Who is that girl whose hand you asked for? What kind of girl am I supposedly going to marry?” 

“What do you mean? Why are you saying that?” Balqees was confused by her brother’s questions.

“I’ve always hated Baktash. He was the only one against me and Fariba’s engagement. But now, he crossed his line. He wanted to slap me.” Kareem continued to rant. “For your sake, I didn’t tell anyone about the incident at the mosque, but this time, I won’t let him get away with it. He must pay for his actions. But first, where is Suraya’s house? I want to talk to her mother.”

“Her mother is not home,” Balqees answered.

“I’ll wait for her until she comes.”

“But she won’t come.”

“Why not? Where has she gone to?”

“I don’t know.” Balqees was afraid. Her brother couldn’t know that they lived in their guesthouse.

“Give me the address,” he commanded. Balqees froze in panic and fell silent. “Why are you shaking? What’s going on?”

He grabbed her by her hair and yelled at her to give him the address. Balqees saw no other option but to explain everything to him. Kareem was red with rage.  

He slapped her. “Why did you hide this from me? Did you want me to marry this girl who was the daughter of a traitor working with disbelievers? And who does Baktash think he is? Is he looking for trouble with the government? He brought unknown women to his home and is shamelessly spending time around them. How did he think he could hide this from everyone?”  
Before leaving, Kareem warned Balqees not to say a word of their conversation. He threatened her that if she didn’t keep their secret, her husband would also be in trouble.

` `Suraya went home. She hid the painting in her dresser. When she was in bed getting ready to sleep, she kept thinking about Baktash. She thought about the risks that Baktash took for her, and imagined his face, his almond eyes, his tall silhouette and the beard that framed his face beautifully. For the first time, she realized that he was truly handsome and kind at heart.  
She asked herself why she always thought of him as rude; maybe his being a mullah had affected her judgement. She thought that if her father were alive, he would have been happy to see her get married to Baktash, because he had proven himself to be an intelligent and brave man, and was also from a good family.   
She thought of herself and her own situation: she was homeless, fatherless, unprotected. “Humaira would never accept me marrying her son,” she thought to herself. Then, she remembered that Humaira had been there the other day when they came to propose to her, and concluded that Baktash must have convinced everyone. She started to hope that her bad days were coming to an end.

` `In the same moment, Baktash was restless and sleepless. He thought about Kareem’s proposal to Suraya, and about how his mother had gone on Kareem’s behalf. How could he now tell his mother about his feeling for Suraya, and that he wished she marry no one but him? He decided to speak about this matter with his mother the next day.
