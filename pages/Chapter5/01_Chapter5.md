### CHAPTER 5

` `When Baktash arrived, she greeted him but got no response. Suraya was surprises when he ignored her, but she considered the matter too important to give up on talking to him. She took a deep breath and followed him into the house. When Baktash saw her at his bedroom door, he became short of breath and anxious. “I have something to tell you,” Suraya said. 

“Okay, but what are you doing here?”

“I want to talk to you alone.” Baktash froze in place.

“What do you want to talk to me about?”

“It’s about your sister.” Baktash felt slightly relieved, but when he looked around his room, he noticed all the drawings he’d made of Suraya were visible.

“Please get out,” he urged.

Suraya insisted. “But I need to talk to you.”

“Let’s talk in the yard.”

“I want to talk here.”

“Please, if my brothers or sisters-in-law see you in here, it will end badly for us.” Suraya had no choice but to leave. In her anger, she didn’t notice the paintings in Baktash’s room.

` `Baktash hid the paintings under his mattress immediately after she left. He thought that she definitely must have seen them, but then thought to himself that she would have shown a reaction if she had noticed. He was walking around in circles thinking to himself: “I was just starting to forget her and she came to me. Why did she come? What did she want to say? I should have listened to her instead of being rude.” He was lost in a spiral of thoughts.

` `When Suraya angrily entered to her room, her mother came to ask what had happened. When Suraya explained to her, her mother said: “You have done what you could for them. Don’t blame yourself. You can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped.”

“Yes. Unfortunately, her mother and brothers are brainless.”

“Don’t say that.”

Her mother’s gentle warning didn’t stop Suraya from continuing to express her frustration. “I don’t know who Baktash thinks he is. He thinks he’s so above everyone else, that everyone is dying to speak to him. I didn’t want to talk to him but I did it for his sister.”

Suraya’s younger sister laughed and said: “He must think he is a movie star, that just because he helped us, we’re probably falling in love with him.”

“You must admit that he did help us a lot, Nasreen pointed out. “If it wasn’t for him, I don’t know where we would be today.”

The elderly woman said jokingly: “You girls are just offended that he won’t speak to anyone but me. He must really like me.” They all laughed, and the night was lightened with joy. Although they didn’t have good food on most days, and on some days none at all, they always found a way to maintain a positive outlook and find joy in life.
