### CHAPTER 9

` `In the morning, he couldn’t find a chance to talk to his mother. His father noticed he was anxious and asked what was wrong. Baktash told him about Kareem’s proposal to Suraya. Muhammad was surprised to hear about it and asked: “Where does Kareem know Suraya from?” 

“I think Balqees told him she was our neighbor, and he saw her when she was teaching the kids,” Baktash said.

“Does your mother know about this?”

“She was the one who went to ask for her hand on Kareem’s behalf.”

“That’s not what I meant. What I meant is: does she know about your feelings?”

“What feelings are you talking about?”

“You’re my son. I know you better than you know yourself.” 

Baktash blushed. “I don’t know when or how I fell for her.”

“But I’m upset that you didn’t share how you were feeling with me,” Muhammad said. Baktash kept silent. “Don’t worry,” Muhammad said, “Go to university and I will speak to your mother about this.”

` `After his day at university, on the way home, he was feeling nervous about his mother’s reaction, but he reassured himself that his father would be able to handle the situation. He thought to himself, with a mix of joy and nervousness, that he would soon marry Suraya. 

` `The weather was pleasant. The trees were swaying in the wind, their leaves turning yellow; the scene was similar to a picturesque painting. The sun was bright and its red and gold reflections shone everywhere.   
Baktash thought to himself: “They were right to say that autumn is the season of love.” He wished that next autumn, he would be by Suraya’s side, and spend hours and hours with her, and fall deeper in love with her day after day. He was so deep in thought that he didn’t notice he had already arrived at his street.  
Suddenly, he saw police cars and a handful of men gather in front of his door. One of them shouted: “Look! Baktash arrived!” 

Two Talibs carrying guns approached him and asked: “Are you Baktash?”

“Yes, I am,” he responded. With no further explanation, they arrested him. He wanted to talk, but they didn’t give him a chance. He yelled and resisted, and they hit him with the back of their weapons. He fell to the ground, unconscious. He could only see blurred face and silhouettes. He saw his mother and father yelling. He saw Kareem standing by the Taliban with a grin of satisfaction on his face.   
After hours, he slowly gathered his senses. When he opened his eyes, he realized that he was in prison. He was alone in a cell, lying in a corner. He tried to get up, but the pain that shot through his body kept him on the ground.   
He shouted and knocked against the door to make himself heard. When the door opened, a few members of the Taliban entered and started to beat him, accusing him of apostasy and betrayal, and berating him about keeping unrelated women in his house, treating mosques as hotels and disrespecting a highly-ranked Talib. 

“You are sentenced to death,” they announced to him. They beat him until he was lifeless on the ground, every inch of his body covered in blood.

Baktash was in a deplorable state. He remained in prison for multiple days. He couldn’t tell the difference between night and day. The police officers only came to give him food or water. Every time he opened his eyes, he would see Suraya’s face. He worried about her and her wellbeing.  
In the first few days, Baktash couldn’t even find the strength to eat. One day, as an officer came to his cell and saw him on the ground, he threw water at his face to wake him up. Baktash was startled awake and saw that he had left him some bread. He ate it. It was disgustingly stale, but he had no choice, as he hadn’t eaten for several days.   
Then, he looked at the only window in his cell. It was covered up, but moonlight was still shining through. He stared in the direction of the moon and imagined the face of Suraya. He said to himself, “The moon has imperfections that Suraya’s face doesn’t have.”   
He worried about what might have happened to her. He asked God to grant the remaining of his life to Suraya. 

He thought of the good memories he had, of the softness of his pillow and the warmth of being surrounded by family. Now, he had nothing but rats for company and four wall shutting him away from all he loved. He thought that people should be more content with what they have and felt immense guilt for being ungrateful for the countless blessings he had in his life.  
Everyone in his family was ungrateful. His father complained about his mother, his mother complained about her children and the children complained about their destiny. He felt guilty for previously supporting oppressors and enabling them. In his guilt, he felt that he deserved to be punished by the same people he once supported.
