### CHAPTER 3

` `A few hours later, everyone went their own way. Baktash first went to the mullah’s funeral, then to the park were everyone had returned. He asked Haidar about the tent where Suraya stayed. He went to her tent and called her name. She came out and greeted him. 

“I didn’t want to bother you,” he started, “but I just wanted to ask how you were doing.”

“We’re fine,” Suraya responded, “Thank God. And the weather is good, too.”

“Has your house been completely destroyed?”

“It wasn’t ours. It was a rental, but yes, it was destroyed.”

“So where are you going to go?”

“We don’t have a place to go, but I hope we will find one soon.”

“We have a spare room at our place. If you want, you can stay there rent-free,” Baktash proposed.

“No, thank you. We don’t want to bother you.”

“It’s no bother. Can you call your father or brother?”

“I don’t have any.”

“What do you mean?”

Suraya’s mother came out and asked who she was speaking to. Baktash introduced himself. The mother said: “We are four women living alone. We have responsibilities, and if we came to your house, people will get the wrong idea. We also don’t have the means to pay rent for you right now.”

Baktash insisted: “But you have nowhere to go. How long will you live in a tent? Once houses are rebuilt, the government will throw you out of the park. I don’t want money; I just want to do good.”

“Until they kick us out, God will have found a solution for us. Don’t get yourself into trouble,” Suraya’s mother said.
