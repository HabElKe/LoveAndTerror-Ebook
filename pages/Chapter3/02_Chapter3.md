` `Baktash went back home and told his father about them. His father said: “What a shame to have four helpless women and be unable to help them because of people gossiping and getting the wrong idea.”

` `A few days passed since the incident and Baktash wanted to visit Suraya, but he felt embarrassed. However, he passed through the park every day on his way to the mosque, even though it was a longer route.  
One day as he was returning home, he saw a policeman forcing people out of the park. He noticed Suraya’s younger sister in the crowd. The women’s faces were all covered. Baktash talked to the policeman, who told him that they must leave as the rain has stopped. “This is a park, not a hotel,” the policeman said.

Baktash was embarrassed to ask Suraya to come to his house again. He stood far from the crowd. There were only two or three families. He noticed a woman was approaching him and he greeted her. She said: “Did you recognize me? I am Suraya’s mother.” 

“Yes,” Baktash said.  

“We are two families in need of shelter. Five women and a ten-year-old boy. Is the place you told us about still available for rent?”

“Yes. It’s a room separate from our house, but it will be small for six people.”

“That’s not a problem.”

Baktash led them to his house. When his mother opened the door, she was surprised to see so many women with her son. Baktash said: “Don’t panic. They are our new tenants.”

“We don’t have a place to rent,” his mother Humaira said.

“We have a guestroom in the courtyard that currently serves no purpose. They will pay rent for it.”

Baktash led them to the room. It was very small and only had one window and two doors, one leading outside and the other to the yard. It had a small toilet. Suraya and her mother liked the room and brought their belongings in. They only had a carpet, two pillows and some cookware. Humaira went to the kitchen to get some tea and called Baktash to go with her.   

“What are you doing?" she asked. "Why did you bring these women in our home without any of their male relatives? Do you have any idea about the trouble you and your brothers will be in if anyone finds out about this?” 

“They have no place to go. Their house has been ruined by the floods, and they have a young boy with them.”

“He’s not that young. You’ll get yourself in big trouble. Who are they? Do you even know them?”

“Yes, I know them," Baktash insisted. "They are good people.”

“Tonight, you should speak to your brothers about this. If they agree, you can give them the guesthouse.”
