` `Later that day, after Baktash came home from work, everyone was waiting for him.   
His older brother Hamed said: “Why did you bring them here without asking? If you want to act recklessly, you shouldn’t let it hurt the rest of the family.   
His younger brother Hashem agreed: “This is also our house, and you should have asked for our opinion.” 

Their father cut them off: “This is neither Hamed’s house nor yours. This is my house. And Baktash asked for my permission and I agreed. If you aren’t happy with that, you can leave.”

Humaira said: “You want to kick us out for four unknown women?”

The father, Muhammad, said: “No one ever listens to me in this house. Haven’t you been trying to teach your sons to be good Muslims? What is wrong with helping four women in need? If neither I nor my sons were with you, you would be in the same position as these women today. There is no guarantee that something like this wouldn’t happen to you in life.”

“Okay,” Humaira said, “but if people hear about this, the gossiping and badmouthing will be never-ending.”

“Should we kick them out just because of what people will think?”

“Father, I don’t think this is a good idea,” said Hashem.

Muhammad ignored the objections and asked his wife to bring their guests some food. “They might not have anything to eat,” he said.

` `Later that night, Muhammad asked Baktash to come see him. “Do you know why they don’t have any relatives by their side? Do you have any idea about their story?” Muhammad asked.

“No,” responded Baktash.

“Your mother might be right to raise concerns about hosting complete strangers. You should investigate a little bit about them and understand what happened to them.”

` `After prayer, Baktash went to their old address to find out more about them. Humaira also asked them about their lives. Both Baktash and his mother came to Muhammad and told him what they had learnt about their guests’ life story.

` `Suraya’s father used to work with the previous government. He was an outspoken liberal, and wrote a lot of articles and books. When the Soviets left, he was on good terms with the *mujahideen* and didn’t leave the country. When the Taliban took over and when they killed Dr. Najeeb, he feared for his life and attempted to leave the country.   
He sold his house in Kabul and wanted to use the money to go to Pakistan and then bring his family along, hoping they could later get to Europe. On his way to Pakistan, he got arrested by the Taliban, who accused his of apostasy and imprisoned him, then executed him.   
Suraya and her family were staying with her aunt’s family, until they, too, fled the country. Because Suraya’s father and her aunt’s husband had worked with the previous government, the Taliban confiscated all of their belongings.   
Suraya, along with her two sisters and mother, were left homeless. With the little money they had, they tried to rent a small house. Because they had no male relatives, they couldn’t work either. For a while, Suraya gave lessons to children in their homes and used the money for house necessities. But when the Taliban found out, they warned her that if she continued, they would execute her. After that, they made some money by cooking fast food at home and sending Suraya’s younger sister to sell it in the market. When the floods started, they had no options left.

 ` `Muhammad sighed heavily. Humaira said: “We must help them. They also have an elderly woman with them who lost her sons in a bombing and lives with her grandson. We can’t accept the rent money from them and we must share any food we have with them.”

Muhammad said: “Tell their daughter to come teach my grandchildren, and that I will pay her for her efforts.” Everyone nodded in agreement. Humaira talked to Suraya’s mother Nasreen about Muhammad’s proposition, and Nasreen agreed.
