### Preface

In the name of Allah, 

Ignorance is the cause of all human miseries. Ignorance is darkness and wisdom is light. My motivation behind writing the story of Baktash and Suraya is that I am afraid of people\'s ignorance.  
Ignorance and the denial of knowledge is the cause of much death and suffering among the people of my country.  

This is the story of two lovers who are separated by ignorance, two lovers who have no obstacles except the society they are in, two lovers who pay the price of other people's intolerance.  
Baktash and Suraya are not just fictitious characters; they represent countless innocent victims who were killed unjustly. War causes destruction, and ignorance is the beginning of that destruction.

This story was written in accordance with the taste and understanding of the readers, and with social issues in mind. It addresses problems arising from social norms and the difficulties of two lovers in reaching each other.
