### CHAPTER 10

` `A few days later, a couple of officers came to his cell and dragged him out without saying a word. They brought him into a general’s office. The general said: “You should be ashamed of yourself. If you hadn’t had anyone to save you, you would have been stoned to death.”

They took Baktash to his father. They hugged as if they hadn’t seen each other for years. Baktash wanted to ask about Suraya, but his brother told him to stay quiet so as to not get into trouble again. Baktash returned home among his family members, who were all elated to see him. He was searching for Suraya among them, but she wasn’t there. He asked everyone about her, but nobody would give him an answer. He ran to Suraya’s house, searching for her everywhere, but she was nowhere to be found. He shouted, demanding to know where Suraya and her family were.   
His father said: “When you get better, we will tell you.” 

Baktash objected: “I want to see her now.” 

“I will take you to her, but it is dangerous; you might go back to prison. You have to promise me you will be patient until tomorrow,” said Muhammad. Baktash continued to argue, but in the end agreed to wait until the next day.

` `The next day, Baktash was ready to meet Suraya even before sunrise. He went to his father and told him he wanted to see her now. Muhammad agreed, and they left together. Muhammad took Baktash to *Shuhada-e-Saleheen*.   
On the way, Baktash repeatedly asked his father about what had happened, but Muhammad urged him to be patient. Baktash saw a crowd praying janazah and spotted his brothers Hamed and Hashem among the group. When he got out of the car and came closer, he realized that it was a janazah prayer for three deceased. It was raining. His father took him aside to talk. He said: “This is a very difficult time for us, but we must be aware of our honor that we have lost due to this situation.”

Baktash interrupted him: “Where is Suraya?”

“When you were arrested, Suraya and her family were arrested, too. Later on, wer found out that one of the Taliban members wanted to capture them as a reward because they thought Suraya’s father used to cooperate with enemies. When Suraya resisted and stood up against them, one of the Taliban members shot her. First, she went into a coma, but then she passed away.

They publicly shot Nasreen on Friday after accusing her of maintaining a relationship outside of marriage with you. Suraya’s sister Sawsan killed herself out of fear of ending up like her mother or sister. We tried our best to help them. Your brother Hashem sold his shop to get some money to release them, but it was in vain. They wanted you dead, too, but by the grace of God and with our repeated efforts you were finally saved from them. 

From their family, only the youngest sister is alive, and she is with us.”

Baktash fainted upon hearing how events had unfolded in his absence. When he woke up, he found himself surrounded by his family members. He stood up and said: “I saw a terrible nightmare. I saw that Suraya and her family were dead.”

Everyone started crying. Kareem was there, too. He said to Baktash: “I am sorry. It was my fault. I didn’t know it would end like this.” He wanted to kiss Baktash’s hands to ask for forgiveness, but Baktash stopped him and punched him in the face. 

“I just wanted to marry her,” said Kareem, trying in vain to justify himself. “I didn’t know it would end like this. I am guilty, and I will accept any punishment from you.” He offered his gun to Baktash.

Baktash grabbed the gun and sat on the ground, weeping, in disbelief. 

Instead of pointing the gun at Kareem, he pointed it at his own head. Muhammad leaped toward him and snatched the gun out of his hands. A bullet was shot into the ceiling of the house. Baktash fainted again.  
After a few moments, he woke up, realizing that he was alone in the room. He got up and ran away, careful not to be seen. He went outside barefoot and limping, with his forehead bandaged and wearing only his night clothes.

` `He wandered the streets aimlessly, still in shock, unable to fathom the horror of the events. He found himself near *Shuhada-e-Saleheen*. He entered the cemetery and found the place where he had come with his father in the morning. He searched for the name of Suraya among the graves. He saw a board that read: “Suraya, daughter of Fawad Ayoubi.” The one next to it read: “Nasreen Ayoubi.” He fell to the ground and kept crying all night and well into the next morning.
