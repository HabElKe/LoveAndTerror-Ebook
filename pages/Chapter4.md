### CHAPTER 4

` `The very next day, Suraya stared teaching Muhammad’s seven grandchildren. Baktash wanted to express his feelings to Suraya but couldn’t. He wanted to discuss it with his mother, but was afraid she would get angry with him and kick Suraya and her family out. He was afraid people would doubt the sincerity of his intentions in helping them. He made conscious efforts not to think about Suraya or come across her. Every time she came to teach his nephews, he went out and wandered in the neighboring streets. He never approached the guesthouse. Yet, when he was alone in his room, he would draw Suraya’s face. He asked Allah for patience and strength, but whenever he fell asleep, he would see her in his dreams. He was avoiding Suraya and her family. They thought that he probably avoided them because he was a religious man, so they never came to Baktash’s house unless it was so that Suraya could do her lessons. Otherwise, when they needed something, they sent the elderly woman to the house.

` `Suraya gave lessons in the living room to all the children, but also to Humaira and her daughters-in-law. While she was busy teaching one day, Muhammad came to her and said: “You are like a daughter to me. Actually, you remind me of my oldest daughter, Zohal. She was intelligent, hard-working and a bright student. After the Taliban took over and the schools were banned, her mother insisted Zohal get married, but she always wanted to be a teacher. She was not happy with the idea of marriage, but I couldn’t convince Humaira. I will never forgive myself for it. Now, she’s the mother of two children, but when I see you, I think: If only she could continue her education, she would be like you, intelligent and independent.” 

Suraya said: “She still is intelligent.” 

“But not independent. They aren’t treating her well. One bad decision can make one’s life miserable. Humaira is a good woman, but her one problem is that she is uneducated. Because of that, my children’s lives also got ruined. I value education. My children must do so, too. But two of them are shopkeepers and one of them quit his university degree and now he is a Mullah. That’s not what he’s meant to be. He was a good artist, but he stopped that, too. My daughters got married at around fourteen or fifteen. Fariba is fourteen years old and engaged. I couldn’t do anything for the two others, but I want to educate Fariba and give her a chance for a better future with you help. I know you are wise and understand the importance of what I am discussing with you. I also wish Baktash could go back to university. I want you to convince them.”

“There isn’t a lot I can do, but I would like to help you. I will speak to them.”

First, Suraya spoke to Fariba about her father’s concerns. Fariba told her: “My mother says that an honorable woman belongs in her husband’s house, and that the role of a woman is to get married and have children.”

“You are only fourteen. You don’t know the meaning of marriage yet,” Suraya explained.

“No, I do. My cousin got married and she is really happy.”

“How can you know for sure?”

“Everyone says she’s happy, and she’s even younger than me.”

“Marriage means a lot of responsibility and difficulties that you’re still too young to handle. Do you even know your fiancé? Do you love him?”

“No, I don’t know him well, but I saw him twice. He’s ten years older than me. Honestly, I am scared of him. Zohal also says the same things as you, but I have no choice. If I don’t get married, my sisters-in-law won’t leave me in peace. If I don’t get married to him, they’ll force me to get engaged to my sister-in-law’s brother. I heard some terrible things about him. He’s an addict and he beat his first wife to death. He will marry me by force. He works in the government and he has previously threatened my brothers.”

“But your father has your back.”

“I know. He told me that he’ll take me to Pakistan so that I can complete my education, but my mother refuses. She said that I can’t be alone in another country. My brother Hamed agrees with her, too. He threatened to kill me if I ever left.”

“With your father is on your side, you shouldn’t be afraid. What do *you* want?” Suraya asked her. “Do you want to get married or continue your education?”

“I want to continue my education. Zohal was telling me that one of her classmates now became a doctor. I would love that, but it’s impossible here. Girls don’t have the right to go to school or even to have anyone teach them at home. And if I choose to leave, what will my mother and brother do?”

“Don’t worry, I will find a solution.”

` `Suraya went to Humaira to discuss the topic with her, but she was met with cold resistance. “I don’t want you to bring this subject up,” Humaira said. “We let you come into our home, but that doesn’t mean you have the right to interfere in our family matters.”

` `Suraya felt sorry for the young Fariba and angry with her own luck. She thought to herself: “I would die to be able to continue my education, but I don’t have the means. This family has the means, and instead of supporting her daughter, the mother stands in her way.” Suraya wanted to discuss it further with Baktash, so she waited in the yard for him to return.
