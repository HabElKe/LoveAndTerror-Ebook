` `After some arguing back and forth, the crowd lost hope and started dwindling. Baktash went back into the mosque to continue his prayers. In prostration, he felt the ground pulling him and couldn’t get back up. As he was trying to move, sweat was dripping down from his face and he thought about the crowd that came asking for help. He thought to himself: “Allah must be displeased with me.” As he said “*Allahu Akbar*,” he was finally able to pull himself away from the ground and he realized that it was the first time he had experienced such a paralyzing feeling. He promised himself to go see the victims of the floods and check what he could do to help.

` `He headed towards the park where the government had set up tents as shelter for the displaced. It was early in the evening and the rain was slow but steady. He bought some bread on his way to the park and as he entered, people gathered around him when they saw the bread in his hands. They fought for the bread and Baktash pulled himself away from them with difficulty.   
He looked around. There were tents everywhere, one for every two or three families. They were provided by the United Nations, brown-colored and stamped with the UN logo. Water had infiltrated and damaged the tents that were haphazardly set up throughout the park. Women stayed inside, fully covered and scared. Many children were visibly suffering from sickness, shivering with cold. Upon seeing this situation, Baktash felt disappointed and blamed himself for his behavior. He thought to himself: “If this is the situation in the capital, how is the situation in other states?”   
Suddenly, he spotted the man from the crowd earlier. He apologized to him and asked him to come to the mosque after the night prayer, and to bring everyone else along.

` `Then, Baktash went home and told his mother about the events of the day. His mother was worried that the government would hear about Baktash allowing people inside the mosque and punish him. Baktash, however, was fearless. He told his mother to cook dinner with whatever they had at home. They had some beans, which had been given to them by the previous government. His mother Humaira prepared beans and bread, and after the prayer, she brought it to the mosque. Baktash distributed the food among the people who hurriedly ate everything, as if they hadn’t eaten for years. Baktash asked Haidar, the man he had spoken to before: “Doesn’t the government provide food to you?”

“This is Afghanistan, my brother. If there is no foreign aid, the government can’t do anything. Even if there were aid, only one percent of it reaches the people, and the rest goes into the pockets of the government.”

“But the current government is different. It’s an Islamic government,” Baktash replied. Haidar laughed.

` `Baktash was surprised to see the girl who used to be in his university sitting among the people eating food. This was the second time he noticed her. He wanted to check up on her, but couldn’t gather up the courage to. He sat in a corner of the mosque and looked at her from afar. He didn’t realize the time passing by while he was watching her, and the girl started to cover her face when her eyes suddenly fell on Baktash. They both looked at each other for a still moment, and the girl quickly threw the veil on her face. Baktash was shaking and he stood to go to another spot. He could only think about the girl’s eyes and completely forgot about the trouble he would be in if the people of the city were to know about his actions tonight. He only thought about the girl. 

A few minutes later, he heard a soft voice saying to him: “I think you know who I am.” Baktash looked back and saw a girl with her face covered. 

“Who are you?” he asked.

She raised her veil to show her face. She was *that* girl. 

“Yes, I recognize you,” Baktash confirmed.

“Thank you for what you did for us tonight. I thought that after the things I said, you would turn me in to the authorities.”

“You were the one who said these offensive words?” She nodded yes. Baktash wasn’t very surprised; he knew her and recognized the way she spoke. “I just wanted to help,” he said, shrugging his shoulders, “that’s all.” 

“Thank you,” the girl repeated, “but how will you justify yourself in front of the authorities?” 

“I’ve thought of it already.” 

“If you need help, I could help you.” 

Baktash refused: “I will resolve it myself,” he said. The girl said goodbye and Baktash fell silent. He didn’t want her to go. He wished he could ask her what she was doing here and why she was in this desperate situation, but he couldn’t utter the words. He barely managed to ask her name. 

“Why? Do you want to raise a complaint about me to the government?”

“No,” he said. 

“It’s Suraya,” she said, and she turned to leave.

A few moments later, the guardian came to Baktash and asked: “What are we going to do? If people come for morning prayer and see the mosque in this situation, they will accuse us of disrespecting the sanctity of the mosque.”

“Don’t worry,” Baktash reassured him. “I’ve thought of something.”

` `Baktash left the mosque. It was pouring and there was a big thunderstorm. Everything was drenched. He struggled on his way to the man who taught him shariah and Islamic studies.   
His teacher, Abdul Raheem, was a very well-known scholar in Afghanistan. Many of the laws imposed by the Taliban were established by him. He was highly respected among them and held a powerful rank and status. His home was in *Karte New*, far from Baktash’s house.   
He knocked on the door and the teacher’s son opened it. Their house had two floors. It was an old building that used to have only one floor, but when the teacher got wealthy, he constructed a second floor. The mullah lived with his three wives and all their children. Baktash entered into the living room, where the mullah was sitting with his newest bride, who was fifteen years old.   
The mullah had long hair and a thick beard, he was in his eighties or nineties, always holding his cane and carrying a terrible expression on his face.   
After greeting him, Baktash recounted the story of the people seeking shelter at the mosque to him. 

“What have you done?" the mullah responded angrily. "This was your first day working at the mosque, and this is how you behave? You disrespected the mosque by gathering two hundred men and women in one place.” 

Baktash responded: “They would have died otherwise.” 

“They would have deserved it,” retorted the mullah. “Why do you think they are flooded and punished while we aren’t? They must have been sinful for something like that to happen to them. And today, you committed a big sin, too, and you must be held accountable for it. Now, go back home. When I talk to the authorities, I will let you know.”

Baktash wanted to respond, but they kicked him out. He went back to the mosque and told everyone what had happened.   
Suraya said: “We are all involved in this. If you get punished, we will take responsibility, too.” Everyone agreed to support Baktash in case of trouble.   
Baktash didn’t share the details of what happened at his teacher’s house with his family. He didn’t want them to suffer from his actions. All night long, everyone was unable to sleep. The rain was heavy and showing no signs of stopping.   
Suraya came to Baktash and reassured him. “Don’t worry,” she said, “Allah is watching over us.”

` `The night, along with all of its worry, tension and fear, slowly came to an end. Everyone was waiting for people to come to morning prayer, but because of the intense rain and heavy floods, only a couple of men came, and they promised to keep the secret. The sun rose, bright and warm after several stormy days, putting an end to the bad weather and gently heating the air.   

` `At around 10 a.m., people started leaving the mosque to avoid causing more trouble to Baktash. Some remained with him to support him in case the authorities came to punish him for his deed. Suraya was one of those who had remained, along with some other elderly women. At noon, there were still no signs of the authorities.   

` `At prayer time, people came to the mosque to pray, and some of them asked Baktash why he didn’t attend mullah Abdul Raheem’s funeral. Baktash was shocked at the news. They told him that mullah Abdul Raheem died the night before. His house had collapsed from the rain. His entire family died except for his first wife. Baktash was in disbelief. He has just seen him last night. He asked several people, all of whom confirmed that the mullah was indeed, dead. Baktash inquired about what happened to the first wife. They told him that she said that a man had come to see the mullah at the house, and as soon as the man left, the house collapsed. Baktash asked if the wife knew who that man was. They said that she didn’t, and that she only saw him leaving.   

Later, Baktash walked to the back of the mosque where Suraya and the others were waiting for him. He told them that the mullah had passed away. They laughed.  

Haidar said: “Allah punished him for badmouthing two hundred people.” 

Baktash disagreed: “No, he was a good man. He was just angry last night.” 

“Good?” Suraya responded. “You said that he had three wives and that the youngest one was fifteen while he was ninety. Also, he accused strangers that he never saw in his life. Do you still consider him a good man?”

“Never mind,” Baktash said. “The good news is that he hasn’t told anybody about us.”

Haidar asked: “How are you sure?”

“People told me that the house collapsed just after a visitor left. That was me. The mullah didn’t have time to inform anybody.”
