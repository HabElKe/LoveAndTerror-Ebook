` `After some arguing back and forth, the crowd lost hope and started dwindling. Baktash went back into the mosque to continue his prayers. In prostration, he felt the ground pulling him and couldn’t get back up. As he was trying to move, sweat was dripping down from his face and he thought about the crowd that came asking for help. He thought to himself: “Allah must be displeased with me.” As he said “*Allahu Akbar*,” he was finally able to pull himself away from the ground and he realized that it was the first time he had experienced such a paralyzing feeling. He promised himself to go see the victims of the floods and check what he could do to help.

` `He headed towards the park where the government had set up tents as shelter for the displaced. It was early in the evening and the rain was slow but steady. He bought some bread on his way to the park and as he entered, people gathered around him when they saw the bread in his hands. They fought for the bread and Baktash pulled himself away from them with difficulty.   
He looked around. There were tents everywhere, one for every two or three families. They were provided by the United Nations, brown-colored and stamped with the UN logo. Water had infiltrated and damaged the tents that were haphazardly set up throughout the park. Women stayed inside, fully covered and scared. Many children were visibly suffering from sickness, shivering with cold. Upon seeing this situation, Baktash felt disappointed and blamed himself for his behavior. He thought to himself: “If this is the situation in the capital, how is the situation in other states?”   
Suddenly, he spotted the man from the crowd earlier. He apologized to him and asked him to come to the mosque after the night prayer, and to bring everyone else along.

` `Then, Baktash went home and told his mother about the events of the day. His mother was worried that the government would hear about Baktash allowing people inside the mosque and punish him. Baktash, however, was fearless. He told his mother to cook dinner with whatever they had at home. They had some beans, which had been given to them by the previous government. His mother Humaira prepared beans and bread, and after the prayer, she brought it to the mosque. Baktash distributed the food among the people who hurriedly ate everything, as if they hadn’t eaten for years. Baktash asked Haidar, the man he had spoken to before: “Doesn’t the government provide food to you?”

“This is Afghanistan, my brother. If there is no foreign aid, the government can’t do anything. Even if there were aid, only one percent of it reaches the people, and the rest goes into the pockets of the government.”

“But the current government is different. It’s an Islamic government,” Baktash replied. Haidar laughed.

` `Baktash was surprised to see the girl who used to be in his university sitting among the people eating food. This was the second time he noticed her. He wanted to check up on her, but couldn’t gather up the courage to. He sat in a corner of the mosque and looked at her from afar. He didn’t realize the time passing by while he was watching her, and the girl started to cover her face when her eyes suddenly fell on Baktash. They both looked at each other for a still moment, and the girl quickly threw the veil on her face. Baktash was shaking and he stood to go to another spot. He could only think about the girl’s eyes and completely forgot about the trouble he would be in if the people of the city were to know about his actions tonight. He only thought about the girl. 

A few minutes later, he heard a soft voice saying to him: “I think you know who I am.” Baktash looked back and saw a girl with her face covered. 

“Who are you?” he asked.

She raised her veil to show her face. She was *that* girl. 

“Yes, I recognize you,” Baktash confirmed.

“Thank you for what you did for us tonight. I thought that after the things I said, you would turn me in to the authorities.”

“You were the one who said these offensive words?” She nodded yes. Baktash wasn’t very surprised; he knew her and recognized the way she spoke. “I just wanted to help,” he said, shrugging his shoulders, “that’s all.” 

“Thank you,” the girl repeated, “but how will you justify yourself in front of the authorities?” 

“I’ve thought of it already.” 

“If you need help, I could help you.” 

Baktash refused: “I will resolve it myself,” he said. The girl said goodbye and Baktash fell silent. He didn’t want her to go. He wished he could ask her what she was doing here and why she was in this desperate situation, but he couldn’t utter the words. He barely managed to ask her name. 

“Why? Do you want to raise a complaint about me to the government?”

“No,” he said. 

“It’s Suraya,” she said, and she turned to leave.
