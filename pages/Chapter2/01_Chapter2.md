### CHAPTER 2

` `The initial rainstorm was followed by several days during which it was raining non-stop, so much so that some areas were completely flooded. A lot of homes were severely damaged and many people were killed. Still, it wouldn’t stop raining. Mentally removed from these events, Baktash was preparing for his new job in a big mosque in Kabul. He wore a brand new white *perahan tunban* and a hat, grabbed his prayer beads, wrapped a shawl around his shoulders and headed to prayer. After prayer, he was performing a few *nafl* prayers when he heard a lot of noise coming from the courtyard. He got up and went to the main gate, where he saw a crowd gathered talking to the guardian of the mosque. Baktash went to the guardian to ask what was going on. Before the guardian could speak, a voice from the crowd said: “Our area has been completely flooded and all our homes and belongings have been destroyed and we have no place to go! Please let us seek shelter in the mosque until the rain calms down and we can look for a place to go.”

The guardian said: “This is a mosque, not a hotel. Hasn’t the government given you shelter? Why don’t you go there?”

The man responded: “The government set up tents for us outdoors in parks, but the rain is damaging everything. Water is everywhere and our children are all falling sick. A newborn even died yesterday.”

Baktash said: “This is not our problem. You must speak with the people in charge.”

The man replied: “We spoke to them, but they refused. They claim they have no money and are waiting for foreign aid, but we will die waiting. Please save us.”

The guardian said: “If there were only men here, it wouldn’t have been a problem. But the children will ruin the mosque along with your wives who will ruin the sanctity of the place. It’s impossible.” Baktash nodded his head in agreement.

From the crowd, a girl spoke up: “Are you more worried about the sanctity of the mosque or the death of a couple hundred people? Hasn’t Allah said that in times of trouble we should come to Him? Isn’t this the house of God? We didn’t come asking for your help, we came asking for Allah’s help.”

The guardian scoffed in exasperation. “This is indecent behavior. Shut up, you shameless woman!”

The girl said: “It’s not such a big deal if you pray at home for a few days instead of at the mosque. If the children were to damage the mosque as you say, would it collapse to the ground? But if the children stay in this harsh weather, they will die and you will be responsible for their deaths. How could you refuse giving people a roof over their heads for just a few days?”

The guardian got angry and wanted to slap the girl, but Baktash stopped him. “Don’t you understand that this is a holy house?” Baktash said, “It must remain pure, and half of you probably haven’t done your ablutions. If one of you makes a mistake, the mosque becomes impure and it will affect everybody in it.”

The girl replied: “How narrow-minded of you! What are you so concerned about? If that’s your issue, we will clean everything after us before leaving.”

“Your cleaning won’t be enough,” retorted Baktash.

“We will rebuild the mosque from scratch for you. Is a building more valuable than the lives of a couple hundred people?”

Baktash was firm in his disagreement. “There is no way you can stay inside. Go back form where you came.”

“Don’t you fear God? What are you going to answer Him when he asks you about your hypocrisy?”
