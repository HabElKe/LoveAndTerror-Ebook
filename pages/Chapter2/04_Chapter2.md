A few moments later, the guardian came to Baktash and asked: “What are we going to do? If people come for morning prayer and see the mosque in this situation, they will accuse us of disrespecting the sanctity of the mosque.”

“Don’t worry,” Baktash reassured him. “I’ve thought of something.”

` `Baktash left the mosque. It was pouring and there was a big thunderstorm. Everything was drenched. He struggled on his way to the man who taught him shariah and Islamic studies.   
His teacher, Abdul Raheem, was a very well-known scholar in Afghanistan. Many of the laws imposed by the Taliban were established by him. He was highly respected among them and held a powerful rank and status. His home was in *Karte New*, far from Baktash’s house.   
He knocked on the door and the teacher’s son opened it. Their house had two floors. It was an old building that used to have only one floor, but when the teacher got wealthy, he constructed a second floor. The mullah lived with his three wives and all their children. Baktash entered into the living room, where the mullah was sitting with his newest bride, who was fifteen years old.   
The mullah had long hair and a thick beard, he was in his eighties or nineties, always holding his cane and carrying a terrible expression on his face.   
After greeting him, Baktash recounted the story of the people seeking shelter at the mosque to him. 

“What have you done?" the mullah responded angrily. "This was your first day working at the mosque, and this is how you behave? You disrespected the mosque by gathering two hundred men and women in one place.” 

Baktash responded: “They would have died otherwise.” 

“They would have deserved it,” retorted the mullah. “Why do you think they are flooded and punished while we aren’t? They must have been sinful for something like that to happen to them. And today, you committed a big sin, too, and you must be held accountable for it. Now, go back home. When I talk to the authorities, I will let you know.”

Baktash wanted to respond, but they kicked him out. He went back to the mosque and told everyone what had happened.   
Suraya said: “We are all involved in this. If you get punished, we will take responsibility, too.” Everyone agreed to support Baktash in case of trouble.   
Baktash didn’t share the details of what happened at his teacher’s house with his family. He didn’t want them to suffer from his actions. All night long, everyone was unable to sleep. The rain was heavy and showing no signs of stopping.   
Suraya came to Baktash and reassured him. “Don’t worry,” she said, “Allah is watching over us.”

` `The night, along with all of its worry, tension and fear, slowly came to an end. Everyone was waiting for people to come to morning prayer, but because of the intense rain and heavy floods, only a couple of men came, and they promised to keep the secret. The sun rose, bright and warm after several stormy days, putting an end to the bad weather and gently heating the air.   

` `At around 10 a.m., people started leaving the mosque to avoid causing more trouble to Baktash. Some remained with him to support him in case the authorities came to punish him for his deed. Suraya was one of those who had remained, along with some other elderly women. At noon, there were still no signs of the authorities.   

` `At prayer time, people came to the mosque to pray, and some of them asked Baktash why he didn’t attend mullah Abdul Raheem’s funeral. Baktash was shocked at the news. They told him that mullah Abdul Raheem died the night before. His house had collapsed from the rain. His entire family died except for his first wife. Baktash was in disbelief. He has just seen him last night. He asked several people, all of whom confirmed that the mullah was indeed, dead. Baktash inquired about what happened to the first wife. They told him that she said that a man had come to see the mullah at the house, and as soon as the man left, the house collapsed. Baktash asked if the wife knew who that man was. They said that she didn’t, and that she only saw him leaving.   

Later, Baktash walked to the back of the mosque where Suraya and the others were waiting for him. He told them that the mullah had passed away. They laughed.  

Haidar said: “Allah punished him for badmouthing two hundred people.” 

Baktash disagreed: “No, he was a good man. He was just angry last night.” 

“Good?” Suraya responded. “You said that he had three wives and that the youngest one was fifteen while he was ninety. Also, he accused strangers that he never saw in his life. Do you still consider him a good man?”

“Never mind,” Baktash said. “The good news is that he hasn’t told anybody about us.”

Haidar asked: “How are you sure?”

“People told me that the house collapsed just after a visitor left. That was me," Baktash said. "The mullah didn’t have time to inform anybody.”
