### CHAPTER 11

` `At midday, he heard the call to prayer and went to a nearby mosque. It was a Friday, and the mullah was advising people during his weekly sermon. Baktash went towards the mic and declared: “I have a few words that I wish to share with you.” 

When people saw his state, they thought he was crazy. “He’s delusional,” they said, “Nobody should listen to him.” The mullah said, “We should give him a chance and listen to was he has to say.”

“I am a mullah myself,” Baktash started. “I am also a student of law in university. I used to be ignorant, just like you guys, and I used to listen the advice of other mullahs, blindly accepting what they said as the absolute truth. Every time mullahs would talk about women and dictate what they should and shouldn’t do, list countless restrictions on them, dehumanize them and devalue their feelings, I used to enjoy their speeches.   

And then I saw an angel, and fell in love with her and finally opened my eyes and became wise. I helped the needy and gave shelter to a few helpless, homeless women. And then, the Taliban accused me of dishonoring the religion and maintaining illegitimate relationships with these women I had helped.  

But this is not the point. The point is that I am still alive despite these accusations, despite the crimes they claim I committed. I am alive, but these three innocent women are dead. Because they were women. And I am a man. And my family is rich and we have important connections. 

You talk about justice; do you think this is justice? They killed these three innocent women in public and no one objected. No one demanded to see any proof or to see the man who was also involved in the illegitimate relationship they claim happened. This is not only the fault of the Taliban, but also our fault. We believe and accept everything they say and think this is Islam. Have any of you even read the Quran?”

A person stood up from the crowd and said: “Not only is he crazy, but he’s also disrespecting Islam!”

Baktash continued: “I never disrespected any religion. I am disrespecting the hypocrites among you, who claim they have the right to kill the innocent. So, come and kill me. If you like torturing people, come and torture me.   
We are people so familiar with murder that we attend public killings with our children. We like killing people. It is not the fault of the Taliban; we are a barbaric people. If we weren’t, we wouldn’t have accepted the barbaric behavior of the Taliban. We aren’t any different from them, because we twist and use religion to our own advantage. We are not the followers of God. We are the followers of the devil.”

One of the men among the crowd yelled: “*You* are a follower of the devil, not us!”

Baktash retorted: “No, we all are. This is a cursed country. Each one of us will die miserably and the devil is happy watching us.”

` `The crowd became increasingly restless and angry. A man slapped Baktash, and Baktash kicked him back. More people got involved and the fight escalated. Everyone wanted Baktash dead, repeating that he had disrespected religious beliefs with his words. They beat him until he fell in the middle of the mosque, lifeless.   
He was bleeding very badly and was unable to open his eyes, but he didn’t say a word or resist the pain. He saw a light and Suraya approaching, wearing a white dress, beaming with beauty. Her name was the last word he uttered.

The crowd’s anger didn’t subside, and they kept hitting and kicking Baktash’s body until the police interfered and carried him away.   

The next day, his family buried him beside Suraya’s grave. The story that had started with a glimmer of hope for love was over. And finally, they were sleeping by each other’s side.   
Baktash’s paintings of Suraya were still in his room, and Humaira’s house still resonated with Suraya’s sweet words, and Muhammad still heard the voices of Suraya and Baktash reciting poetry together.   
From their unfinished love story, only Baktash’s drawings of Suraya remained. Every day, Muhammad would talk to the face on these drawings, and Humaira would hold her son’s clothes close to her and smell his scent now that he was gone.   
Muhammad liked to imagine that Baktash and Suraya were together in heaven, that they escaped a harsh world to find eternal comfort in each other’s company, but the reality was that they were robbed of the joy of being together, and that they were both violently plucked away from this life way too early, buried with hearts full of crushed hopes and unfulfilled dreams.
