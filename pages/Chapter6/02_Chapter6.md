“My first wife was from the countryside and idiotic. She drove me crazy, never understood what I wanted. We fought and I hit her, and she died because of her own stupidity. Now, I want this girl. You should buy some sweets and get ready for the proposal. Talk to your husband as well.” And with that, he left.

Balqees couldn’t tell her brother the real story about Suraya’s family, so she called her mother and told her that this marriage was not a good idea and that the girl was not compatible with the family’s ideals, hoping that this would stop Kareem.

` `Later in the evening, he came back. “Why did you speak badly about the girl to our mother?” he asked angrily. “The girl is more than ideal for me. She is the girl that I’ve always dreamed of. I’ve fought to earn a reward like this my whole life. She’s angel-like.”

“She’s not that beautiful.” At this point, Balqees felt that resisting was useless.

“Have you seen someone more beautiful than her?” he asked. Balqees couldn’t find an answer. Suraya was indeed truly beautiful. “Enough talking,” Kareem said. “You have to propose to her for me. If you say she will not obey easily, I know how deal with her. She’s not physically strong. If I slap her, she’ll obey right away.”

` `That same day, after Baktash came home, he went to Suray to apologize. “Why did you come to my room that day?” he asked.

She told him about Fariba’s situation. “Also, your father is disappointed in you,” she said. “Why did you leave your university studies unfinished? If I had such a chance, I wouldn’t waste a single moment away from my studies.”

“It just had to be like that,” he said dismissively.

“What do you mean? Is the matter money? You have two brothers that are well-off and can help you. There’s no other valid reason to leave a law degree behind.”

“If I were to finish my law degree, I would use it to make money. Right now, I’m making money without it. So, what’s the difference?” Baktash argued.

“You’re comparing being a lawyer to being a mullah. Not everything is about money. Education makes you wise, makes you human. After your degree, you could become a lawyer or a judge.”

He smiled and said: “Do you think the Taliban care about law and order? Only they decide the law and how to keep the order.”

“The Taliban won’t last forever. Even if they do, they will be forced to change their politics and laws. Don’t you see how many people are standing against them?”

Baktash considered her words for a few moments. “I’ll go to the university tomorrow and see what I can do.”
