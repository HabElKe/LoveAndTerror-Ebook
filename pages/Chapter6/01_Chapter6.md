### CHAPTER 6

` `A few days after the argument between Suraya and Baktash, Balqees’ family came to visit. Balqees warned everyone that her family must not know about Suraya’s and family presence, because many of her family members were involved with the Taliban, and she wanted no trouble. They stayed for three days, and did not know of Suraya and her family.   
After the guests had left, Suraya came to the house to continue giving lessons. She was busy teaching the children when someone knocked on the door. Balqees opened the door and saw her brother Kareem, who was an old suitor of Fariba. He was a widower and worked with the Taliban. He was in Kabul because of work. He entered the house and saw Suraya. 

“Who is she?” he asked. Balqees froze in fear, speechless. Kareem insisted: “Who is she and what is she doing here?”

Suraya was afraid because he was a physically imposing and intimidating man, with long hair and a full beard and carrying a gun in his hand. She got up and said: “I am a guest. I was just chatting with the children.”

“If you were chatting, why do you have a pen in your hand?”

“She’s right. She’s a guest,” added Balqees. “The children were studying and she was staying beside them.”

Kareem left the room and took his sister along with him. “I hope that what you’re saying is true. Tell me, who is she?”

“She’s our neighbor, they moved here recently.”

“Is she married?”

“No, she’s single.”

“She’s really beautiful. Why didn’t you propose to her on my behalf?”

“For you?”

“Yes. Your sister-in-law is going to marry a shopkeeper instead of me,” Kareem scoffed. “Do you know that girl’s family? What does her father do?”

“But she’s educated, and her father passed away. She has three sisters and they all live with their mother.” Balqees didn’t like where the conversation was going.

“That’s great. If her father isn’t in the picture, she’ll marry me easily.”

“She’s from Kabul. She’s not used to our customs. She’ll want to choose her husband by herself, and her family isn’t used to demanding money from the groom. She’s also wise and outspoken—a bit too much for my taste. She won’t be easily submissive or obedient. She’s not a countryside girl that will cook and take care of cattle.”

“I really like her, and if I want something, I will get it. Your sister-in-law wasn’t that pretty anyway. But this girl is. If she agrees, then great, but if she doesn’t, I know how to convince her,” he said, waving his gun.

“I don’t think she’s the right fit for you,” Balqees protested.
