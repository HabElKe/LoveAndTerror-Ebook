Everyone turned to look at Baktash. They were surprised to hear him reciting poetry. Fariba said to him: “You have changed a lot. You also trimmed your beard.” 

Baktash said: “Yes, I’ve changed both my appearance and myself.” 

“I think that the old version of your brother is finally back.” Muhammad said to his daughter. He turned to Suraya: “Continue your reading, I really enjoyed it.”

Suraya read: “After Shams went missing, Mawlana Mohammad Balkhi went to Damascus to search for his beloved, but there were no signs of him. He didn’t accept defeat and kept searching for him in all of Damascus and Aleppo, day after day. He looked everywhere he could imagine Shams would be. He would go to the place where they met for the first time, and he would look around imagining him in front of him. But every time Mawlana would approach him, Shams would disappear.”

Suraya closed the book and said: “It’s late. I think this is enough for today.” 

“This is a fantasy,” Fariba commented. “I don’t think anyone could fall for a person like that.”

“Mawlana saw God through Shams. That’s what explains his attachment to him, why he was so beloved to him,” Suraya explained.

“So, it was mystical love. A normal person could never fall in love like that.”

Mohammad intervened: “No, normal people can also fall in love like that. Isn’t that right, Baktash?”

“I think love makes people live longer. A person who hasn’t known love hasn’t lived life to the fullest. A heart without love is like a dark prison where feelings are locked away.” Baktash looked into Suraya’s eyes.  
She stood up and excused herself: “It’s late now, I must leave.”

Mohammad saw his son’s feelings towards Suraya, and understood why he had suddenly changed. Leaving the house, Suraya was taken aback by Baktash’s words and the way he looked at her. She went into her room and saw Balqees and Humaira sitting together. After greeting them, her mother told her that they were here to ask for her hand in marriage.   

“Marriage to whom?” Suraya asked. 

“They didn’t mention much detail,” her mother said, “but they’ll come back with more family members soon.” 

Her sister said: “There’s only one single man in their family. It must be Baktash.” 

Suraya scoffed. “I’m not marrying Baktash,” she said. “He’s too conservative and controlling.” 

Her mother said: “I know you have many differences, but don’t worry. Next time they come, I will decline.”
