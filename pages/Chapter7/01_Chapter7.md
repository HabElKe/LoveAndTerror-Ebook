### CHAPTER 7

` `The next day, Baktash went to the university. Deep down, he did it for Suraya, to show her he cared about her thoughts and opinions. Seeing his friends made him very happy; he hadn’t realized that he missed them. There were only 14 students left of the original 69. The Taliban had banned the universities in the beginning of the year, but opened them again a while later.   
Baktash’s classmates greeted him, but were weary of his Taliban-like appearance. One of his friends described what happened since Baktash left: “All the girls are now at home. some of the boys went abroad while others joined resistance groups against the Taliban. A few also joined the Taliban, unfortunately. There’s only 14 of us who want to continue our education and make a difference. Even though the degree won’t necessarily help us financially, we don’t want to quit.”

Baktash repeated Suraya’s words: “This situation won’t last forever. Either they will change their policies or they will lose their control and power.” Everyone was surprised to hear such words coming from him.   
His friend Khaled said: “I thought you supported the Taliban. Or are you a spy that wants to inform the Taliban about our thoughts and opinions?”

Baktash smiled and said: “I’m your friend of two years. I wouldn’t betray you. I disobeyed the Taliban more than you ever will.”

They continued their discussion about politics, and after lessons, he returned home. On his way back, Baktash was in a lighthearted and joyful mood. When he entered, he hugged his father tightly and thanked him. His father said: “I missed this version of you, Baktash.”

` `He went to his room, trimmed his beard and threw his hat away. He wanted to thank Suraya. When he went to the living room, Suraya was reading a poem of Mawlana Jalaluddin Rumi to his father and his sisters.

*A lover asked his beloved,*
*Do you love yourself more*
*than you love me?*
*The beloved replied,*
*I have died to myself*
*and I live for you.*

*I've disappeared from myself*
*and my attributes.*
*I am present only for you.*
*I have forgotten all my learning,*
*but from knowing you*
*I have become a scholar.*

She wanted to turn the page to keep reading, but Baktash continued the poem instead.


*I have lost all my strength,*
*but from your power*
*I am able.*
*If I love myself*
*I love you.*
*If I love you*
*I love myself.*
